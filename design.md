If you love The Lord of the Rings, use our SDK to easily query [The One API to rule them all](https://the-one-api.dev/documentation).

## Notes

This module is the lightweight wrapper around the RESTful - The One API including these features:

- uses the popular [got](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got) package
- you can limit data on a per call basis or max records returned to streamline testing
- data is both cached using got's caching scheme as well as stored as internal variables
- core functionality is in the request function which handles all of the requests, query string manipulation, etc.

## Future Enhancements

- {expand: true} feature would replace all ids with names (e.g. quotes contain movie and character id rather than the names)
- ideally all the helper functions could be autogenerated from a JSON file
